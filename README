1. Introduction

  This library contains the software framework for the E14 experiment.

2. Supported platform

  o Linux on PC

  o Mac on PC (Leopard and Snow Leopard)

3. Requirements

  o subversion
          Many recent Linux distribution have subversion already.
  o ROOT library
  o Geant4 (>=8.3) with CLHEP library
  o readline, history, and, curses libraray (standard for linux)
        * For Mac
          Builtin readline is not valid.
          Re-install readline by yourself. (Install using Mac ports is fine.)
  o GNU make (standard for linux)


4. Installation on PC Linux

   see INSTALL

5. Package (Example package, novice01)

	novice01
	|-- Makefile        
	|-- REQUIREMENTS    Necessary for the PACKAGE.
	|-- novice01        For Header files.
	|   `-- func.h
	`-- src             For souce files.
	    `-- fun.cc

    1) REQUIREMENTS is necessary for each package.
        In other words, if a directory contains REQUIREMENTS,
           the directory is a package.
        Inside REQUIREMENTS
	  #config         ---> If an entry begin with #, it is indeed
                                 a required package, but it is  not a library.
	  MidasManager    ---> This is required libraray and will be linked.
	  ......
    2) PACKAGES
         If PACKAGES is exist, make is done recursively for the packages
           written in the PACKAGES.
    3) ${E14_TOP_DIR}/e14/EXPORTED
          If some packages in e14 is exported,
              they are listed in ${E14_TOP_DIR}/e14/EXPORTED.
          If e14 (top of all the packages) is exported,
            ${E14_TOP_DIR}/e14/SUBDIRS is made and used instead.
6. Makefiles

  2) $E14_CONFIG_DIR/Makefile.bin
                   # All targets are defined, which is standard
                   #   for libraries without geant4.

                   # If MAINS=a b, then a.cc and b.cc with main()

  3) $E14_CONFIG_DIR/Makefile.g4
                   # All targets are defined,
                   #         which support Geant4/CLHEP/ROOT.

PACKAGE      =     # or package name, as PACKAGE = $(shell basename `pwd`)
MAINS        =     # or exe name ---> single name is allowed.
                   # If MAINS=a, then a.cc with main()
                   #     should be in package dir.
